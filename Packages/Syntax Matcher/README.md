Syntax Matcher for Sublime Text 2
========================================

This syntax highlighter was taken directly from the work done by
[Felipe Coury](https://github.com/fcoury) [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/1514352)
with some modifications to make Cucumber matching better and then turning
it into a Sublime Text package for all to use.


Installation:
-------------

Syntax Matcher has been submitted to the Sublime Text 2 Package Control index and should
be available soon to download using Package Control.  With this done you will be able to
install with the following:

1. Command Palette (CTRL + Shift + P)
2. Typing install and selecting Package Control: Install Package.
3. Choose Syntax Matcher from the pop up menu

In the mean time, you can install manually by just cloning the respository into your
Sublime Text 2 Packages directory (the following example is for Mac OSX):

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
    git clone https://github.com/reinteractive-open/Syntax-Matcher.git
